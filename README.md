# How to use

The `png` folder contains PNG files, the `ico` folder contains identical files in Windows Icon format. Note that the ICO files use PNG compression and are rather large, so they may not work with older software and/or operating systems.

How to set the program icons heavily depends on your operating system.
- On Windows, right-click any link file (like one to an executable as usually found on the desktop), click Properties -> Other Symbol -> click on the top button next to the file path to select a file. Select the .ico file you want to use; raw PNG files are not accepted! Click all of the OK buttons and it should update within a few seconds.
- It is not known to the author if macOS allows changing icons. If you have information on how to achieve it, please submit a pull request.
- On Linux, it heavily depends on your desktop manager. Please submit a pull request if you know how to do it on one particular desktop manager.
